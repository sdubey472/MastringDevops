## Install Docker


First, in order to ensure the downloads are valid, add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system:

```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

Add the Docker repository to APT sources:

```
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
```  

Next, update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo:

```  
sudo apt-get update
```  

Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu 16.04 repo:

```
apt-cache policy docker-ce
```

Notice that docker-ce is not installed, but the candidate for installation is from the Docker repository for Ubuntu 16.04 (xenial).

Finally, install Docker:

```
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
``` 

Docker should now be installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot. Check that itâ€™s running:

```
sudo systemctl status docker
```
